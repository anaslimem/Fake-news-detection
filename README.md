# Fake News Detection System

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to detect and classify fake news articles. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and advanced machine learning models, the system provides a reliable method for identifying misinformation.

## Features
- High accuracy in detecting fake news using Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Text preprocessing and word embeddings with Word2Vec for enhanced feature extraction.
- Intuitive interface built with Gradio for user interaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/anaslimem/Fake-news-detection.git
   cd Fake-news-detection
   
2. **Install required libraries:**
   pip install numpy pandas sklearn nltk gensim matplotlib gradio
   
3. **Download necessary NLTK data: Open a Python shell and run the following commands:**
     import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('wordnet')
